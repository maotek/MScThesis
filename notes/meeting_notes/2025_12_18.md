## Notes
- discuss new papers 
- EventVCE maybe ignores time information, as that is not required in object detection etc.
- `Depth Any Event Stream: Enhancing Event-based Monocular Depth Estimation  via Dense-to-Sparse Distillation`: looks interesting as it is published alongside Depth AnyEvent and seems to do the same thing: read more in depth
- `Task-Specific Knowledge Distillation from the Vision  Foundation Model for Enhanced Medical Image Segmentation`: Interesting concept of first pretraining VFM with domain dataset, and then distilling.

## TODO
- Test little concentration net adapter in front of frozen VFM.
- Test EventVCE (only if there is code).
- Test pretraining VFM first, and then distill.
- Read the intersting papers more in depth
