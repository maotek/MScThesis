# Notes

- Two ways of knowledge distillation:
    - Casting Vision Foundation Model to event by inputting some kind of event representation to VFM.
    - Distilling knowledge from VFM to event-based depth estimation model.

- Read DepthAnyEvent in-depth.
    - What did they do in their experiments?
