# Notes

- Think about benchmark dataset / models.
- Monocular event depth estimation really finetuned on e.g. DSEC, may not work well on general scenes. So the goal is to maybe show that training using foundation models can get okay accuracy on a range of datasets.
- Set up Zotero for paper sharing.


- Biweekly meeting with Nergis starting 25 November 14:00
