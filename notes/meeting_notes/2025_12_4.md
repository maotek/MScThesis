# Notes
- Discussed the DepthAnyEvent Paper in depth
    - How is training done?
        - Time window is 50ms, but dsec/mvsec has 100ms between images. How are recurrent versions trained?

- (LDANet (lightweight deformable attention) does not outperform EReFormer, but DepthAyEvent does?)
    - Because LDA is lightweight, so expected

- Next: look in literature to find different event representations.
