## Notes
- Questions:
    - Alignment of RGB and Event (DepthAnyevent/DSEC paper?)
    - How is dense depth collected?
- Event representations
    - Concentration network
    - Tencode
    - ![alt text](image.png)

- look for VFM, event camera, application
- look for 2-3 adaptations
- List representation methods
