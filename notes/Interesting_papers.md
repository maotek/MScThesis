## Event-Based Stereo Depth Estimation With Motion  Guidance and Left–Right Consistency
-> Formulas of metrics RMSE, MAE, 1PE, 2PE

## PCDepth: Pattern-based Complementary Learning for Monocular  Depth Estimation by Best of Both Worlds
-> Maybe find gap here

## Depth AnyEvent: A Cross-Modal Distillation Paradigm for Event-Based  Monocular Depth Estimation
-> Maybe try new representations for events

## Depth Any Event Stream: Enhancing Event-based Monocular Depth Estimation  via Dense-to-Sparse Distillation
-> Similar to Depth AnyEvent

## Distil-E2D: Distilling Image-to-Depth Priors for Event-Based Monocular Depth Estimation
-> Interesting to see what gap to find

## Papers to read:
- A time-related voxel representation method for event camera -> event representation
- ECSNet: Spatio-temporal feature learning for event camera -> Event representation
